# FusionGPT

Fusion_GPT is an Autodesk Fusion 360 extension that integrates OpenAI's GPT models, allowing users to chat with AI directly within Fusion 360. The AI can provide design insights, answer questions, and interact with the Fusion 360 environment.

## Roadmap

1.  [ ] **Basic AI Chat**: Connects to OpenAI's API and provides a chat interface within Fusion 360.
2.  [ ] **Persistent Context**: Allows model selection and retains conversation history over restarts.
3.  [ ] **Feature Tree Parsing**: Extracts and provides the feature tree as context for AI responses.
4.  [ ] **AI-Driven Interactions**: Enables function calling for AI to interact with Fusion 360 objects.

## Notes
Maybe implement backend generic to be able to use stuff like ollama
